[GraphQL](https://qubitpi.github.io/graphql.github.io/) is a language specification published by Facebook for
constructing graph APIs. The specification provides great flexibility in API expression, but also little direction for
best practices for common mutation operations. For example, it is silent on how to:

- create a new object and add it to an existing collection in the same operation.
- create a set of related, composite objects (a subgraph) and connect it to an existing, persisted graph.
- differentiate between deleting an object vs disassociating an object from a relationship (but not deleting it).
- change the composition of a relationship to something different.
- reference a newly created object inside other mutation operations.
- perform any combination of the above edits together so that they can happen atomically in a single request.

Elide offers an opinionated GraphQL API that addresses exactly how to do these things in a uniform way across our entire
data model graph.

JSON Envelope
-------------

Elide accepts GraphQL queries embedded in HTTP POST requests. It follows the
[convention defined by GraphQL](https://qubitpi.github.io/graphql.github.io/learn/serving-over-http/) for serving over
HTTP. Namely, ever GraphQL query is wrapped in a JSON envelope object with one required attribute and two optional
attributes:

1. *query* - _Required_. Contains the actual graphQL query.
2. *operationName* - Used if multiple operations are present in the same query.
3. *variables* - Contains a json object of key/value pairs where the keys map to variable names in the query and the
   values map to the variable values.

For example:

```json
{
    "query": "mutation myMutation($bookName: String $authorName: String) {book(op: UPSERT data: {id:2,title:$bookName}) {edges {node {id title authors(op: UPSERT data: {id:2,name:$authorName}) {edges {node {id name}}}}}}}",
    "variables": {
        "authorName": "John Steinbeck",
        "bookName": "Grapes of Wrath"
    }
}
```

The response is also a JSON payload:

```json
{
    "data": { ... },
    "errors": [ ... ]
}
```

The 'data' field contains the graphQL response object, and the 'errors' field (only present when they exist) contains
one or more errors encountered when executing the query. Note that it is possible to receive a 200 HTTP OK from Elide
but also have errors in the query.

API Structure
-------------

GraphQL splits its schema into two kinds of objects:

1. **Query objects** which are used to compose queries and mutations
2. **Input Objects** which are used to supply input data to mutations

The schema for both kinds of objects are derived from the entity relationship graph (defined by the JPA data model).
Both contain a set of attributes and relationships. Attributes are properties of the entity. Relationships are links to
other entities in the graph.

### Input Objects

Input objects just contain attributes and relationship with names directly matching the property names in the JPA
annotated model:

![GraphQL Input Object UML](img/graphql_input_object_uml.png)

### Query Objects

Query Objects are more complex than Input Objects since they do more than simply describe data; they must
support filtering, sorting, and pagination. Elide's GraphQL structure for queries and mutations is depicted below:

![GraphQL Query Object UML](img/graphql_query_object_uml.png)

Every GraphQL schema must define a root document which represents the root of the graph. In Elide, entities can be
marked if they are directly navigable from the root of the graph. Elide's GraphQL root documents consist of
_relationships_ to these rootable entities. Each root relationship is named by its pluralized type name in the GraphQL
root document.

All other non-rootable entities in our schema must be referenced through traversal of the relationships in the entity
relationship graph.

Elide models relationships following
[Relay's Connection pattern](https://qubitpi.github.io/graphql.github.io/learn/pagination/#connection-specification).
Relationships are a collection of graph _edges_. Each edge contains a graph _node_. The _node_ is an instance of a data
model which in turn contains its own attributes and set of relationships.

#### Relationship Arguments

In GraphQL, any property in the schema can take arguments. Relationships in Elide have a standard set of arguments that
either constrain the edges fetched from a relationship or supply data to a mutation:

1. The **ids** parameter is a collection of node identifiers. It is used to select one or more nodes from a
   relationship.
2. The **filter** parameter is used to build [RSQL](https://github.com/jirutka/rsql-parser) filter predicates that
   select zero or more nodes from a relationship.
3. The **sort** parameter is used to order a relationship's edges by one or more node attributes.
4. The parameters **after** and **first** are used to paginate a relationship across multiple API requests.
5. The **op** argument describes the operation to perform on the relationship. When not provided, this argument
   defaults to a FETCH operation which simply reads the collection of edges.
6. The **data** parameter is provided for operations that mutate the collection (UPSERT, UPDATE, and REPLACE), It
   contains a list of input objects that match the data type of the relationship.  Each _data_ object can be a complex
   subgraph which contains other objects through nested relationships.

Entity attributes generally do not take arguments.

#### Relationship Operations

Elide GraphQL relationships support six operations which can be broken into two groups: data operations and id
operations. The operations are separated into those that accept a _data_ argument and those that accept an _ids_
argument. Operations that edit or manipulate data are restricted to GraphQL Mutation queries:

| Operation | Data | Ids | Mutation Support | Query Support |
| --------- |------|-----|------------------|---------------|
| Upsert    | ✓    | X   | ✓                | X             |
| Update    | ✓    | X   | ✓                | X             |
| Fetch     | X    | ✓   | ✓                | ✓             |
| Replace   | ✓    | X   | ✓                | X             |
| Remove    | X    | ✓   | ✓                | X             |
| Delete    | X    | ✓   | ✓                | X             |

1. The **FETCH** operation retrieves a set of objects. When a list of ids is specified, it will only extract the set of
   objects within the relationship with matching ids. If no ids are specified, then the entire collection of objects
   will be returned to the caller.
2. The **DELETE** operation fully deletes an object from the system.
3. The **REMOVE** operation removes a specified set (qualified by the _ids_ argument) of objects from a relationship.
   This allows the caller to remove relationships between objects without being forced to fully delete the referenced
   objects. **REMOVE** is ony supported in GraphQL mutation requests.
4. The **UPSERT** operation behaves much like SQL's MERGE. Namely, if the object already exists (based on the provided
   id) then it will be updated. Otherwise, it will be created. In the case of updates, attributes that are not specified
   are left unmodified. If the _data_ argument contains a complex subgraph of nested objects, nested objects will also
   invoke **UPSERT**.
5. The **UPDATE** operation behaves much like SQL's UPDATE. Namely, if the object already exists (based on the provided
   id) then it will be updated. Attributes that are not specified are left unmodified. If the _data_ argument contains a
   complex subgraph of nested objects, nested objects will also invoke **UPDATE**.
6. The **REPLACE** operation is intended to replace an entire relationship with the set of objects provided in the
   _data_ argument. **REPLACE** can be thought of as an **UPSERT** followed by an implicit **REMOVE** of everything else
   that was previously in the collection that the client has authorization to see & manipulate.

#### Map Data Types

GraphQL has no native support for a map data type. If a JPA data model includes a map, Elide translates this to a list
of key/value pairs in the GraphQL schema.

Making Calls
------------

All calls must be HTTP `POST` requests made to the root endpoint. This specific endpoint will depend on where you mount
the provided servlet. For example, if the servlet is mounted at `/graphql`, all requests should be sent as:

```text
POST https://yourdomain.com/graphql
```

## Example Data Model

All subsequent query examples are based on the following data model including `Book`, `Author`, and `Publisher`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Book.java" label="Book.java" default>
    ```java
    @Entity
    @Table(name = "book")
    @Include(rootLevel = true)
    public class Book {
        @Id private long id;
        private String title;
        private String genre;
        private String language;
        @ManyToMany
        private Set<Author> authors;
        @ManyToOne
        private Publisher publisher;
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Author.java" label="Author.java">
    ```java
    @Entity
    @Table(name = "author")
    @Include(rootLevel = false)
    public class Author {
        @Id private long id;
        private String name;
        @ManyToMany
        private Set<Book> books;
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Publisher.java" label="Publisher.java">
    ```java
    @Entity
    @Table(name = "publisher")
    @Include(rootLevel = false)
    public class Publisher {
        @Id private long id;
        private String name;
        @OneToMany
        private Set<Book> books;
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Filtering
---------

Elide supports filtering relationships for any _FETCH_ operation by passing a
[RSQL](https://github.com/jirutka/rsql-parser) expression in the _filter_ parameter for the relationship. RSQL is a
query language that allows conjunction (and), disjunction (or), and parenthetic grouping of boolean expressions. It is a
superset of the [FIQL language](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-atompub-fiql-00). FIQL defines all String
comparison operators to be case insensitive. Elide overrides this behavior making all operators case sensitive by
default. For case insensitive queries, Elide introduces new operators.

RSQL predicates can filter attributes:

- In the relationship model itself
- In another model joined to the relationship model through to-one or to-many relationships
- Inside an object or nested object hierarchy

To join across relationships or drill into nested objects, the attribute name is prefixed by one or more relationship or
field names separated by period ('.'). For example, 'author.books.price.total' references all of the author's books with
a price having a particular total value.

### Operators

The following RSQL operators are supported:

- `=in=` : Evaluates to true if the attribute exactly matches any of the values in the list. (Case Sensitive)
- `=ini=`: Evaluates to true if the attribute exactly matches any of the values in the list. (Case Insensitive)
- `=out=` : Evaluates to true if the attribute does not match any of the values in the list. (Case Sensitive)
- `=outi=` : Evaluates to true if the attribute does not match any of the values in the list. (Case Insensitive)
- `==ABC*` : Similar to SQL `like 'ABC%`. (Case Sensitive)
- `==*ABC` : Similar to SQL `like '%ABC`. (Case Sensitive)
- `==*ABC*` : Similar to SQL `like '%ABC%`. (Case Sensitive)
- `=ini=ABC*` : Similar to SQL `like 'ABC%`. (Case Insensitive)
- `=ini=*ABC` : Similar to SQL `like '%ABC`. (Case Insensitive)
- `=ini=*ABC*` : Similar to SQL `like '%ABC%`. (Case Insensitive)
- `=isnull=true` : Evaluates to true if the attribute is null
- `=isnull=false` : Evaluates to true if the attribute is not null
- `=lt=` : Evaluates to true if the attribute is less than the value.
- `=gt=` : Evaluates to true if the attribute is greater than the value.
- `=le=` : Evaluates to true if the attribute is less than or equal to the value.
- `=ge=` : Evaluates to true if the attribute is greater than or equal to the value.
- `=isempty=` : Determines if a collection is empty or not.
- `=between=` : Determines if a model attribute is `>=` and `<=` the two provided arguments.
- `=notbetween=` : Negates the between operator.
- `=hasmember=` : Determines if a collection contains a particular element.
- `=hasnomember=` : Determines if a collection does not contain a particular element.

The operators 'hasmember' and 'hasnomember' can be applied to collections (book.awards) or across to-many relationships
(book.authors.name).

#### FIQL Default Behaviour

By default, the FIQL operators `=in=`, `=out=`, `==` are case sensitive. This can be reverted to case insensitive by
changing the case sensitive strategy.

### Attribute arguments.

Some data stores like the Aggregation Store support parameterized model attributes. Parameters can be included in a
filter predicate with the following syntax:

```text
field[arg1:value1][arg2:value2]
```

Argument values must be URL encoded. There is no limit to the number of arguments provided in this manner.

### Examples

- Filter books by title equal to 'abc' _and_ genre starting with 'Science' _and_ whose total price is greater than
  100.00: `"title=='abc';genre=='Science*';price.total>100.0`
- Filter books with a publication date greater than a certain time _or_ the genre is _not_ 'Literary Fiction'
  or 'Science Fiction': `publishDate>1454638927411,genre=out=('Literary Fiction','Science Fiction')`
- Filter books by the publisher name contains XYZ: `publisher.name==*XYZ*`

Pagination
----------

Any relationship can be paginated by providing one or both of the following parameters:

1. **first** - The number of items to return per page.
2. **after** - The number of items to skip.

### Relationship Metadata

Every relationship includes information about the collection (in addition to a list of edges)
that can be requested on demand:

1. **endCursor** - The last record offset in the current page (exclusive).
2. **startCursor** - The first record offset in the current page (inclusive).
3. **hasNextPage** - Whether or not more pages of data exist.
4. **totalRecords** - The total number of records in this relationship across all pages.

These properties are contained within the _pageInfo_ structure:

```graphql
{
  pageInfo {
    endCursor
    startCursor
    hasNextPage
    totalRecords
  }
}
```

Sorting
-------

Any relationship can be sorted by attributes in:

- The relationship model
- Another model joined to the relationship model through to-one relationships

To join across relationships, the attribute name is prefixed by one or more relationship names separated by period ('.')

It is also possible to sort in either ascending or descending order by prepending the attribute expression with a '+' or
'-' character. If no order character is provided, sort order defaults to ascending.

A relationship can be sorted by multiple attributes by separating the attribute expressions by commas: ','.

Model Identifiers
-----------------

Elide supports three mechanisms by which a newly created entity is assigned an ID:

1. The ID is assigned by the client and saved in the data store.
2. The client doesn't provide an ID and the data store generates one.
3. The client provides an ID which is replaced by one generated by the data store. When using _UPSERT_, the client must
   provide an ID to identify objects which are both created and added to collections in other objects. However, insome
   instances the server should have ultimate control over the ID that is assigned.

Elide looks for the JPA `GeneratedValue` annotation to disambiguate whether or not the data store generates an ID for a
given data model. If the client also generated an ID during the object creation request, the data store ID overrides the
client value.

### Matching newly created objects to IDs

When using _UPSERT_, Elide returns object entity bodies (containing newly assigned IDs) in the order in which they were
created - assuming all the entities were newly created (and not mixed with entity updates in the request). The client
can use this order to map the object created to its server assigned ID.

Type Serialization/Deserialization
----------------------------------

Type coercion between the API and underlying data model has common support across JSON-API and GraphQL and is covered
[here](clientapis#type-coercion).

Custom Error Responses
----------------------

Configuring custom error responses is documented [here](clientapis#custom-error-responses).
