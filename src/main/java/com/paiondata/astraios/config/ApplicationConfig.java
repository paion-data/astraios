/**
 * {@link ApplicationConfig} provides an interface for retrieving configuration values, allowing for implicit type
 * conversion, defaulting, and use of a runtime properties interface to override configured settings.
 * <p>
 * {@link ApplicationConfig} tries to load the configurations from several sources in the following order:
 * <ol>
 *     <li> the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/env.html">
 *          operating system's environment variables</a>; for instance, an environment variable can be set with
 *          {@code export EXAMPLE_CONFIG_KEY_NAME="foo"}
 *     <li> the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html">
 *          Java system properties</a>; for example, a Java system property can
 *          be set using {@code System.setProperty("EXAMPLE_CONFIG_KEY_NAME", "foo")}
 *     <li> a file named <b>application.properties</b> placed under CLASSPATH. This file can be put under
 *          {@code src/main/resources} source directory with contents, for example, {@code EXAMPLE_CONFIG_KEY_NAME=foo}
 * </ol>
 * Note that environment config has higher priority than Java system properties. Java system properties have higher
 * priority than file based configuration.
