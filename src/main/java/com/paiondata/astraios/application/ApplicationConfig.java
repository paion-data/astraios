/**
 * {@link ApplicationConfig} provides an interface for retrieving configuration values, allowing for implicit type
 * conversion, defaulting, and use of a runtime properties interface to override configured settings.
 * <p>
 * {@link ApplicationConfig} supports overriding between properties:
 * <ol>
 *     <li> It will try to load the given property from the
 *          <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/env.html">operating system's
 *          environment variables</a>; if an environment variable with the same name is found, its value will be
 *          returned. For instance, an environment variable can be set with
 *          {@code export EXAMPLE_CONFIG_KEY_NAME="some-value"}
 *     <li> Otherwise, it will try to load the given property from the
 *          <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html">Java system properties
 *          </a>; if such property is defined, the associated value is returned. For example, a Java system property can
 *          be set using {@code System.setProperty("EXAMPLE_CONFIG_KEY_NAME", "some-value")}
 *     <li> <b>The first resource defining the property will prevail.</b>
 * </ol>
